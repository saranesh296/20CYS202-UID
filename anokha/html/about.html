    <div class="rr1">“Anokha Techfest, the annual event of Amrita School of Engineering, Coimbatore provides an unique opportunity for students to participate 
      in fun-filled and challenging events and workshops. The event throws open opportunities for students from all disciplines to challenge themselves and

      become a tradition!!”, Dr. Sasangan Ramanathan, Dean, Faculty of Engineering, Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham.</div>
